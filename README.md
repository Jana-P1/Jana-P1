## A bit about me:


During the quarantine, I jumped on the bandwagon and resigned from my career in financial services. Because of my background in data analysis and R Cmdr, software engineering seemed as if it would be a good fit. A lot of the data science skills I acquired have transferred well into this new career pursuit. I have greatly enjoyed struggling through the challenges and learning so much along the way.
