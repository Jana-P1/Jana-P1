## A bit about me:


During the quarantine, I jumped on the bandwagon, resigned from my career in financial services, and pivoted into something very different... software engineering. Turns out, I really love it! It has been an intense yet enjoyable experience diving head first into this new adventure and unleashing my creative side. When I make spare time, I am an IronMan. I finished my first IronMan in September 2021 and plan to do many more.
